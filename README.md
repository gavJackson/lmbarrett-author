About the author
----

A Reflection of Sophie Beaumont is the debut novel by L M Barrett. After living in Bristol, England for ten years, she now lives in Javea, Spain with her husband and two children. Lorraine always wanted to write a book, but office jobs got in the way so she was finally able to give it a go, once living in Spain. She enjoyed it immensely, especially writing about such a flawed character like Sophie and hopes to be able to follow it up with more books in the near future. Lorraine enjoys reading, hanging out with the kids, learning Spanish and skiing.
